Problem:
    In order to create tokens with different colors, I need to know how to generate different
    integer numbers using Java which would be used for the rgb values.
Resource Used:
    I googled "random number generation in Java" and was brought to a stackoverflow.com page
    (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5887709/getting-random-numbers-in-java) which
    provided information on Random in Java.
Solution:
    For creating a random integer number, the class Random was used.

    Random rand = new Random();
    int  n = rand.nextInt(255) + 1;
    // this generates random number between 255 and 1

Entry #2

Problem:
    In order to create SquareToken, it was required that inheritance be used. When I created the
    SquareToken class, the program would not compile.
Resource Used:
    I used the course textbook "Java: An Introduction to Problem Solving and Programming" to remind
    myself what inheritance is and how it can be implemented. It should that to create a subclass of
    SimpleMapToken, SquareToken would need to be created using the following format -

    public class [DerivedClass] extends [BaseClass] {}
Solution:
    By creating a new class in Android Studio and listing SimpleMapToken as the superclass for
    SquareToken, I was able to create a subclass.

Entry #3

Problem:
    In order to create a complex token, I tried to use Path the same was Polygon is used in standard
    java. However the functions were not the same.
Resource Used:
    I used the Android Developer website to learn more about the Path class.
    https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Path.html
Solution:
    By following the functions provided in the resource above, I was able to create a star shape
    using Path.
